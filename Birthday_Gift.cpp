/*
   Abhishek and Gaurav are the best friends, today is Gaurav's birthday, but
   Abhishek forgot to buy a gift for him. Gaurav is very angry with him. Abhishek has an idea for 
  a gift. Gaurav likes coding very much. So Abhishek gave him a problem to solve as his gift. Gaurav
  likes everything infinitely. Abhishek gave him a sequence problem, such that its first element is equal
   to A (S1=A), and the difference between any two adjacent elements is (Si - Siâˆ’1 = C. In particular, Gaurav
   wonders if his favorite integer B appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that Si = B.
   Gaurav is busy at his birthday party, he asks you to solve this problem.
